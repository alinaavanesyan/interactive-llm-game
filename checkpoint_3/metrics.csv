She is focused on securing an interview for BoJack and getting him to provide soundbites for the book, which suggests that she sees her professional role as more important at this moment.

She is also willing to be blunt and dismissive of BoJack's personal life, as seen in her comments about him being a ""washed-up sitcom horse"" and her sighs of frustration with him. This suggests that she has a more transactional view of their relationship, seeing him as a client or a business opportunity rather than a personal friend or partner.

However, it's worth noting that she does refer to having an assistant, implying that she may have a more personal life outside of her professional relationship with BoJack.","['BOJACK: Who told you Princess Carolyn and I broke up?', ""PRINCESS CAROLYN: BoJack, I secured you an interview.
